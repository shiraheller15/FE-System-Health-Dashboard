Create a global error model when an unexpected error occurs
This is done so that:
everyone who makes an axios call will reach a certain stopping point-(serviceBase.interceptor)
during the return of the response from the server
and there a check is made using an interceptor
and if there is an error, it is checked whether the status is equal to 500 and then the model will open
